Target:
- Everyone, weak and strong bladders alike.

Pain:
- Finding you the closest public bathroom when duty calls and holding it is not an option.

Solution:
- Will find you the closest public facility in your vicinity and show you the quickest route to get there.

App functionality:
- View your current location and see the closest toilets around you;
- View details of any particular toilets you have chosen (i.e. name of toilet, address, facility type, facilities available, rating);
- Favourite a toilet (and be shown a list of your favourites);
- Route guidance to reach the toilet;
- Function to review a toilet;

Assumptions:
- App is designed for and is best viewed on a mobile web browser;
- Only major metropolitan toilets are listed.

Troubleshooting:
- 404 page when clicking on the 'Find a Loo' button: this is due to a lag in the mapbox API and the problem can be resolved by refreshing webpage until the mapbox API responds;
- Navigation page starting location is blank: this is also due to a lag in the mapbox API and the problem can be resolved by refreshing webpage until the mapbox API responds.
